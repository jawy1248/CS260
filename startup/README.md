### Elevator Pitch
Having a simple, helpful, intuitive website for a business is an essential feature. Websites should not be too cluttered or confusing to navigate.\
\
The goal of this project is to turn an old, crumby, miserable website into a new, highly intuite asset for the business. The business this service will be done for is *Wynn's Furniture and Floor Covering*. This is a family business that has been in my family for three generations. The old website was created by a 3rd party with almost no imput for the owner.\
\
I will completely scrap the old website and create a brand new, improved website for this project.
